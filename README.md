# Turkey Marine Spatial Planning Portfolio

A portfolio of 20 GIS and Python projects focused on marine spatial planning 
in Turkish waters — covering the Black Sea, Aegean, and Mediterranean.

## Tools Used
- QGIS
- Python (GeoPandas, PyQGIS)

## Projects

### Project 1 — Turkish MPA Boundary Mapping
**Status: Complete**

Mapped all publicly available Marine Protected Areas in Turkish waters using 
WDPA data. Includes Turkey's EEZ boundaries across three sea basins.

**Key findings:** Turkey restricts most of its MPA data publicly — only 18 areas 
are available through Protected Planet, covering 1.68% of Turkish marine and 
coastal area.

**Data sources:**
- WDPA (Protected Planet)
- Marine Regions EEZ v12
- Natural Earth 1:10m Land

**Output:**
